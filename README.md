# 	Project initially created for "Create With Code 2 - Winter 2021" course run by Unity Live
#
#	"Defeat the (never ending) Monster Trolls, Orcs, and Wolves, that live in and around the castle, with your trusty Sword / Character of Choice
#	 Collect Gems and Other Pickups that each give you different points,
#	 Collect Health Pickups when your energy gets low,
#	 You have only three lives."
#	
#	Each enemy deals different levels of damage to the player, and takes a different number of hits to kill.
#	Enter your name at the start, and your score/name is saved if you beat the highest score so far.
#		
#	Upon re-starting the game, the "last selected" character will be highlighted.
#
#                             ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
#                 IMPORTANT NOTE: DEPENDING ON YOUR CPU SPEED, 
#                 YOU WILL NEED TO REDUCE (or Increase) the "Player Speed" value (default is 5) found on the PLAYERA / PLAYERB / PLAYERC / PLAYERD characters
#                 (the value is on the PlayerController script) which are in the "PLAYERS (they have main cameras)" folder in the Unity Heirarchy View.
#                 Otherwise it can be like Usain Bolt running with rockets strapped to his feet!
#
#                             ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 	Important Note: The following 'Unity Asset Store' free assets are required, and will be imported
# 	to enable the project to be re-built in Visual Studio!
